# Sakharau Illia
Over the 2 years of commercial experience, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of design projects. These have ranged from a streaming platform for yoga practice to financial and analytical microservices. 
As a designer, my ultimate goal is to create products that are not only beautiful and memorable but also functional and effective.
